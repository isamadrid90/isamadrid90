### What I do? 👩‍💻

I've been working as dev full time since more than 7 years ago and I absolutly love it. I've wear different hats, sometime fronted, sometimes backend, sometimes fullstack but I my preference is always backend, I've used different stacks, mainly php+symfony but, currently, I'm using kotlin+spring and I really enjoy it.

I've worked in very different projects, from Authorization&User management for [letgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letgo) to the website and store for [BQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQ_(company))

I started using hexagonal architecture some years ago and it's really interesting, a lot of interesting discussions come from that place, also, I worked with Domain Driven Design, Event Driven Architecture, Event Sourcing and CQRS and I was part of one of the teams that develop and mantain several microservices with sync and asyn communication

On a daily basis I work on Pair Programming and I prefer to do everything with TDD
